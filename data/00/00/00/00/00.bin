  |   Several years after No More Heroes 2... This time, the setting is a   |
  |   small town in the middle of nowhere in the American South. Badman     |
  |   shows up at the trailer Travis has been living in to exact revenge    |
  |   for the murder of his daughter, Bad Girl, and things go horribly      |
  |   wrong. As they battle it out, the two are sucked into the game        |
  |   world of the legendary game console, the Death Drive MkⅡ.             |
  |   Developed by Dr. Juvenile, the Death Drive MkⅡ has six games          |
  |   contained on Death Balls. It's said that collecting all six and       |
  |   then beating each game allows the player to have one wish granted.    |
  |   Travis and Badman team up to use the Death Balls to bring Bad Girl    |
  |   back to life.                                                         |

  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.0.2 (v196608) - Firmware: 6.2                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We heard not too long ago that Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes   |
  |   would be getting a brand new opening cinematic. That update has now   |
  |   gone live, and the video can be seen in-game.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The opening shows Bad Man having a conversation with Dan Smith.       |
  |   It's a big reveal if you’ve played Killer7, as Smith originates       |
  |   from that game. We also learn:                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Badman was actually a character Suda created 15 years ago that is   |
  |   part of the Killer7 mythos; he sold out Dan because he wanted         |
  |   revenge against Travis                                                |
  |   - Dan is now the orchestrator of the events of Travis Strikes Again   |
  |   by giving Bad Man the first Death Ball and the location of Travis     |
  |   Touchdown                                                             |
  |   - Travis is seen as the champ of “above ground”, meaning that things  |
  |   like the Smith Syndicate are even more powerful beings in the         |
  |   underground                                                           |
  |   - Bad Man sits at the exact same place Dan died in Killer7            |
  |                                                                         |
